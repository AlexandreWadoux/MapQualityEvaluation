# Taylor, solar and target diagrams
Code and reproducible example for computing the Taylor, solar and target diagrams. 

Based on the paper: 
*Wadoux A.M.J-C., Walvoort D.J.J and Brus D.J. (2021) An integrated approach for the evaluation of quantitative soil maps through Taylor and solar diagrams* (under review in Geoderma)

## Simulation 
### Reference field 
* grid of size 50 Ã— 50 cells
* we simulate a realisation of a map composed of a linear spatial trend superimposed on a Gaussian random field
* trend has an intercept of 5 and slope parameter of 0.1 for the x-axis and 0.05 for the y-axis
* the Gaussian random field has a mean of zero and a covariance given by C(h) = 5 exp(-h/10), where h is the lag distance
* this map is multiplied by a factor of 0.3 to obtain the ultimate reference map

### Nine modifications of the reference map 
1. a map positionally shifted by 20 units in the x-direction and the y-direction,
2. a map where the x- and y-coordinates are reversed, 
3. a map containing the mean value of the reference map at each coordinate, 
4. a smoothed map obtained by a moving average window of size 5 x 5 units,  
5. a negatively biased map obtained by adding a value of 1 to the reference map, 
6. a map predicted by a random forest model with a single tree and default parameters from the R package ranger using the reference map as calibration data and the x- and y-coordinates as predictors,
7. a map predicted by a single regression tree with default parameters from the R package rpart using the reference map as calibration data and the x- and y-coordinates as predictors, 
8. a map of the upper quartile, made by assigning the mean of the reference map to the values lower than the upper quartile and value of the reference map otherwise,
9. a map of the lower quartile, made by assigning the mean of the reference map to the values higher than the lower quartile and the value of the reference map otherwise.
